# Computer-Architecture

#### **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki - Electrical and Computer Engineering**
##### **Christos Emmanouil, Chatzipemou Aristeidis**

This repository contains the laboretory assignments for course of Advanced Computer Architecture.

The purpose of the exercises was to understand how **gem5**, **McPAT** simulators work and through them to know the parameters and issues that arise during the design process of a CPU.

In the **Lab01**, how gem5 operates is investigated and important information that can be obtained from its results is noted. In the **Lab02**, it is examined how different features of a system change its performance in some SPEC CPU2006 Benchmarks and its cost, using gem5. In the **Lab03**, it is examined how the same features change the power, energy efficiency and energy-delay product of of a system, using gem5 and McPAT.
